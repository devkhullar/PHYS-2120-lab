This repository hosts all the code that I used to create figures for my PHYS 2120 lab, which covers content on:
- Rotational Physics
- Thermodynamics
- Atomic Physics 

Additionally [this](https://github.com/devkhullar/PHYS-2120-lab/blob/main/lab_guide.ipynb) file contains a lab guide that I created to reuse code for my labs, which mostly just required linear and polynomial (2nd degree) curve fitting.
